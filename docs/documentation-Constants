Constants.h contains some things that you may want to change, and some
things that you don't want to change.  
If there are no comments explaining what something does, it shouldn't 
be changed.  


The numerical extensions are important - if they're there, and you
change something, make sure to keep the extension! 
i.e. if you want to get an annealing printout every 256 lines, you'd
change ANN_PRINTEVERY to 256llu, NOT 256.  

SORT_TYPE switches between gnu qsort() and a specialized insertion
sort.  qsort() is good, but includes a lot of overhead.
For small cutoff radaii, the insertion sort will be faster.  If your 
environments have more than 15 or so sites each, qsort() will be faster.

HASH_TABLE_*, GHASH_TABLE* should be played around with.  The former
has a much bigger impact on speed than the latter.  
The latter only applies to structure generation.
